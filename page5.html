As a visual person, the process of making a physical object in real time helped me understand my practice by 
slowing down my thinking and grounding it in material experimentation. Since we spend so much time on our laptops,
 it felt refreshing to let my brain play. Showing the object in different settings also revealed how context completely
  shifts perception, a piece of work feels very different in a gallery than on Instagram. Setting is especially important 
  for my Unit 6 project, a stop-motion film exploring Johari’s Window and how our self image forms through the opinions of 
  others. The work needs time and space for viewers to reflect, rewatch, and piece together the message. I imagine it looping 
  on a projector in a gallery so people can absorb the full picture. This matters because audience engagement changes across 
  platforms; on social media, people often scroll past without experiencing the atmosphere of the work. Working physically will
   continue to influence my process, reminding me that design isn’t just about what I make, but how and where people encounter it. 
   I want to see my work projected on a big screen to let other designers, general viewers into my world especially with my Time and
    Movement project 2, it belongs on a big screen for everyone to see.  Showcasing me as a designer has been a difficult task as I struggle 
    to see myself as one and or call myself one. I’ve been studying this art for 6 years and calling myself an ‘artist’ still feels alien. 
    Dominique de comarmond, Creative Coordinator of Studio 73 wrote in an article <i>The Importance Of Presenting Your Artwork</i>  she discusses
     the importance of lighting, colours, quality and overall how these factors can vastly change the outlook people have on your work. 
     Message is everything when it comes to our art and so is audience and to get your target audience you need to not necessarily cater to
     them but keep in mind who you're designing for in the end
     
     <i>‘Some of the things may be that they have already defined their target 
     audience and no matter the quality, their audience is there for it. Others may have been shared through an influential person and get 
     the recognition that way or perhaps the artist owns their brand or "raw' shots. The list can go on and on. So the importance of quality
     comes into the question of 'How do I want my art to be seen?'. Do you want your piece to stand out and have a more professional shot or
     something a bit more’</i>
     
     . In the end space and where we present and how we present our work is imperative to the message we want to send and how 
    it will be conveyed by the overseer.
