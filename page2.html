        The purpose of this essay is to take a closer, more thoughtful look at me as a designer and to explore Unit 6, not only what we created, but why we created it and to showcase myself as the designer. 
        This reflection allows us to consider who we want our audience to be, how we hope they will interpret our work, and what deeper message or story we aimed to communicate. 
        By examining my creative choices through this lens, I hope to make my work more accessible and understandable for audiences beyond my view. 
        These projects are centred around being perceived and being in a liminal space. 
         I aim to communicate myself to you in a deeper, more vulnerable state and traverse who I am as a designer with refined simplicity.
