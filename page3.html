    <p> Through the workshops and self reflection I have come to the conclusion that I am a quiet creator, I create
        quietly, I present silently and have a hard time taking praise. 
        Which meant for this first Time and Movement group project ‘Human Animals’, I had a difficult time because it was all about communities, identities and mannerisms.
         It focused on perception and how we perceive each other. The workshops helped me gain a better understanding that archives construct narratives, that then helps us decide who we would want to perceive our work, alongside how we the designers best want our story, through our work, to be understood. 
         Our concept was to focus on how we perceive ourselves is built up through others' ideas of us and through that create a playful stop motion, meshing our designs and styles with each other, constantly sharing ideas and feedback. 
        
         Some artists we looked at throughout this project that helped us refine how we wanted to present this concept were,Hannah Hoch, she is best known for her sharply 
         political collages and photomontages, in which she cut up and reassembled images and text from mass media. 
         Through this process, she critiqued popular culture,exposed the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic, and challenged the socially constructed roles imposed on women. 
         As well as Wangechi Mutu, her collages are used to add both physical and conceptual layers to her work. By cutting images from fashion magazines, National Geographic, 
         and books on African art, she constructs figures that feel both elegant and unsettling. 
         The bodies are made up of found objects that resemble strange prosthetics, layered over ink-drawn torsos and limbs. They were visual references for our collage work, 
         both having quite unique collage styles that were perfect for this project. 
         We also looked at John Berger’s ‘Why look at Animals?’ which explores how the relationship between humans and animals has changed over time. Berger argues 
         that animals were once central to human life, culture, and meaning, but modern society has distanced itself from them through industrialisation, zoos, pets, and media. 
         As animals disappear from everyday human experience, they become objects to look at rather than beings we live alongside, symbolising a wider loss of connection between
          humans and the natural world. As our project explores the correlation of animal behaviour to human characteristics. 
         We believed our work was best suited to people who had an interest in psychology as in the video we introduced the concept 
         of Johari’s Window. The Johari Window is a communication tool created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham to help people better understand themselves and how they relate to others. 
         It breaks self-awareness into four Areas open, blind, hidden, and unknown and shows how feedback and self-disclosure can improve trust and communication.

         I struggle with getting people to perceive my projects the way I intend them to be perceived, which stems from my own mannerisms. Therefore having groupmates that
          were confident in presenting and being able to give constant feedback showed me that I needed to be. This all to be said, <i> how did it affect my thought process as a designer? </i>
          It made me understand on a greater level that meaning is shaped through collaboration, feedback, and audience perception. I began to understand that my work does not exist 
          in isolation and that how others interpret it is just as important as my original intention. Working in a group pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me see the value 
          of sharing ideas openly rather than creating quietly on my own. It made me more conscious of how I communicate my concepts and how self-awareness, like the ideas explored 
          through the Johari Window, can strengthen both the design process and the final outcome. As a result, I now approach design as a more reflective and collaborative practice, 
          where feedback is a tool for growth rather than something to avoid.
