    <p> Composition Framework encouraged me to observe my communities  from different distances and levels of intimacy that I had not thought 
        about before, because I believe I work at surface level a lot of the time. As a dyslexic person I find it frustrating to read and research
         because my brain just shuts down. I am a VERY visual person, I go to reference images before I go to text to see what I need to create. My
          sequence told the story of concept to final design, from the ugly to the beautiful. It helped me realise my relationship as a participant 
          and an observer, through the original pinterest board to the end product, you realise that you can create and slightly change one aspect and 
          your message changes. My voice as a design communicator should be louder, at times I lose track of my own words and forget the important bits
           and ramble and I lose my voice, I need to be louder. I gain confidence through compassion and understanding, having someone understand my 
           cluelessness makes me more eager to explain where I got too. My design voice was a big part of my unit 6 project, it being a group project 
           we all did it in our own styles and edited it together, as well as audio I had to voice over with my own words and that made me show a 
           vulnerability that I do not usually offer in group projects.   

        This is very prominent in my unit 6 brief 2 Time and Movement project titled ‘Impermanent  intricacies’. This brief was to create a 
        short film based on four different headings; Possibility, Threshold, Presence and Impermanence. I chose to combine Threshold and possibility which were; 
        
       <i> A minute as possibility: 60 seconds, can change the course of a day
        A minute as threshold: The turning point where something new begins</i>
        
        We were tasked to work directly on film stock, whether that be clear film, inked out or found film that was up to us. I chose to work on 35mm
         black inked out film and scratch into it. I worked on about 12 frames per second. The concept was watching a butterfly hatching from its chrysalis
          and flying around for a few frames and then coming to its end by a very hungry frog! The logline was <i>‘Because in the end if something so delicate 
          can survive in the turbulent winds you can survive the day or not!’ </i> This project was surrounded by my emotional state at that period of time, I was 
          not sure of anything I was creating and felt like creating something that felt like how I felt at the time would help me get me out of my head. The 
          audio played a MASSIVE part of this project as it helped the story come across how I intended it too. As much as it was sad that the butterfly came to
           its demise, the frog got fed and meant it could go on for another day. There is always a light side of the tunnel as nature shows us. 
        
        Some pieces that I took inspiration from where; Black Eyed Dog, how the creator describes it; ‘Alone but for his dog, a man is consumed 
        by obsession with a mysterious creature he encountered in the woods as a child.’ It's an eerily made claymation stop motion film created 
        by Alessandro Cino Zolfanelli that confronts the feelings of mental tiredness and depression, as ‘black eyed dog’ is a known metaphor 
        for the heavy, isolating feeling that depression brings, it follows you, drains your energy and makes it hard to connect, the dog is a presence 
        that won't leave. As well as, Mothlight by Stan Brakhage; his explanation<i> ‘Here is a film that I made out of a deep grief. The grief is my business
         in a way, but the grief was helpful in squeezing the little film out of me, that I said "these crazy moths are flying into the candlelight, 
         and burning themselves to death, and that's what's happening to me. I don't have enough money to make these films, and ... I'm not feeding my 
         children properly, because of these damn films, you know. And I'm burning up here ... What can I do?" I'm feeling the full horror of some kind of immolation, in a way.’ </i>
        I used these both for more metaphorical references and Brakheage’s for more visual references as well. Nature can be used in many,
         many different ways and I felt it fit best for the brief and what I wanted to create to respond to the brief.  
        
        I’m a visual learner, so writing and reading can be frustrating for me. I naturally turn to physical media before digital when creating, 
        and I always work with purpose rarely making something without meaning. Much of my work draws on my childhood and personal experiences, 
        which allows me to be vulnerable without relying heavily on words. I’m heavily drawn to stop motion animation. Even though this was 
        my third time experimenting with it, I loved both the process and the outcome, and I hope to continue exploring it as a central medium 
        in my work.
        
        This unit significantly shifted my thought process as a design student by making me hyper aware of intention, perspective, and emotional honesty.
         I realised that my work is shaped not just by what I create, but by how others perceive it and how I communicate my ideas. Being a visual learner,
          I learned to trust images, movement, and metaphor to express concepts before relying on text or explanation. Working with film, stop motion, 
          and audio encouraged me to embrace vulnerability, experiment with materials, and see small changes as powerful in shifting meaning. Overall, 
          it taught me that my design voice matters, and that being intentional, reflective, and collaborative strengthens both my work and how it is 
          received.
