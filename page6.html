<i>How Did This All Affect My Thought Process As A Designer?</i>

This unit fundamentally reshaped my thought process as a designer by making me more aware of intention, perception, 
and my own creative voice. Through exploring identity, voice, and space, I began to understand that design is not 
just about making outcomes, but about how meaning is formed through process, collaboration, material choices, and
 audience engagement. I realised that my work does not exist in isolation; it is constantly shaped by how others view, interpret, and interact with it.
As a visual and dyslexic learner, this unit helped me recognise that my way of working is a strength rather than a limitation. Trusting physical processes, 
movement, sound, and metaphor allowed me to communicate ideas more honestly and emotionally, without relying heavily on written explanation. Working with stop motion,
 film, and audio encouraged vulnerability and experimentation, helping me express internal states in ways that felt authentic to me.
Collaboration and feedback challenged my instinct to create quietly and pushed me to communicate more clearly and confidently. 
Engaging with frameworks such as the Johari Window and considering context and space made me more conscious of how small decisions 
can significantly alter meaning. I became more intentional about who my audience is, how my work is presented, and where it is experienced.
Overall, this unit shifted my thinking from simply making work to actively shaping how it is perceived. It taught me that my design 
voice matters, that vulnerability can strengthen communication, and that meaningful design comes from reflection, emotional honesty, 
and an awareness of audience, space, and process.
